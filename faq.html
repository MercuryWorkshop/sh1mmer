        <h3>I don't have a USB. Can you send me one?</h3>
        <p>No.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>I don't have admin perms on my personal computer. What do I do?</h3>
        <p>
            You can always try to find a permission bypass, or just ask a friend to
            write the USB for you (assuming you have any).
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>My board name isn't on the list. What do I do?</h3>
        <p>Cry and whine in a corner somewhere.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Is my school going to arrest me for doing this???</h3>
        <p>
            ...no, but they can probably take away your Chromebook perms if they
            find out. Check your district's Technology agreement just to be sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only person who could potentially tell if you unenroll is the person
            in charge of the Google Admin console, but only if they specifically
            check your device. It will show as "offline" and nothing more, although
            they might get suspicious after a very long time.
        </p>
        <p>If you play it safe and not stupid, you will probably be fine.</p>

        <h3>My USB only has 2GB. Can I still do this?</h3>
        <p>
            Yeah, it's pretty easy. All you need to do is to obtain three more
            USBs of the same size, and put them onto a crafting table.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Why does it say that my USB doesn't contain ChromeOS?</h3>
        <p>You probably downloaded the wrong board.</p>
        <p>
            Or the exploit has been patched, which may happen in ChromeOS v112+.
        </p>

        <h3>The file download is slow. Can you give me a faster one?</h3>
        <p>Shim files average around 5GB, so no.</p>
        <p>Skid.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What does skid mean?</h3>
        <p>62.34.241.128</p>

        <h3>I can't re-enroll.</h3>
        <p>#RIPBOZO</p>

        <h3>My chromebook is bricked.</h3>
        <p>#PACKWATCH</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How do I get WiFi passwords?</h3>
        <p>Use the netlog password extractor.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Where do I download a shim?</h3>
        <p>Okay, if I... if I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out, that's left of you, is your eyeball, you'r- you're PROBABLY DEAD! You're probably going to - not you, I'm just sayin', like, if you- if somebody were to, like, push you into a meat grinder, and, like, your- one of your finger bones is still intact, they're not gonna pick it up and go, "Well see, yeah it wasn't deadly, it wasn't an instant kill move! You still got, like, this part of your finger left!" NO I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. NO. I'm making a reference to the fact that, like, if I, like, if I were to get fucking KILLED... I don't know, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'. If- if- okay, if you were to- okay we're gonna take humans out of this, if alien Globgobglobgo 1 fuckin' shoots a disintegrating ray at alien Globglo 2, if there's only fucking TEETH LEFT, it's- it's fucking you're dead, you're dead.

            "If I were to put you in a meat grinder," goddamnit, it's so fucked up! You understand what I'm sayin' though, I'm not actually saying that I'm going to put somebody in a meat grinder, goddamnit. Whatever.</p>

        <h3>The website is down!</h3>
        <p>Wait.</p>
        <hr /> 
        <h3>It says I am using an unofficial image.</h3>
        <p>That's a recovery image, not a shim.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>I can't build on Windows Subsystem for Linux.</h3>
        <p>WSL is not supported. Use a live environment, or even better, switch to Linux.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>The shim is displaying a QR code and asking for an authorization code.</h3>
        <p>That is not something we put in. You are using a raw shim.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Why did I read all this?</h3>
        <p>No idea. You should probably go get a life.</p>
