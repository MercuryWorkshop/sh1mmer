    <h3>What is SH1MMER?</h3>
    <p>
      SH1MMER is an exploit capable of completely unenrolling
      enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by
      the <a href="https://mercurywork.shop">Mercury Workshop team</a> and
      was released on January,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.friday)">Friday the 13th</u>, 2023.

      For more info, check out the <a href="https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-2">Writeup</a>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
      If this isn't working for you, check <a href="#fog" target="_self">"The Fog"</a> section below.
    </h4>

  </div>
  <div class="section green">
    <h3>What you will need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage</li>
      <li>
        <u onclick="alert(messages.pc)">A personal computer or Chromebook;</u> note that you
        need admin perms on Windows/MacOS
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>Flashing a USB</h3>
    <p>
      First, you'll need to find your managed Chromebook's board name. This can
      be done by going to <kbd>chrome://version</kbd> on your Chromebook and
      copying the word after <kbd>stable-channel</kbd>, or with
      <u onclick="alert(messages.board)">a variety of other methods</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your board name is in the list below, your board has a publicly leaked RMA shim. If it's not, you'll have to
      source it
      on your own... somehow.
    </p>
    ambassador, brask, brya, clapper, coral, corsola, dedede, enguarde, glimmer,
    grunt, hana, hatch, jacuzzi, kukui, lulu, nami, octopus, orco, pyro, reks,
    sentry, stout, strongbad, tidus, ultima, volteer, zork
    <p>
      First you need to download a SH1MMER bin at
      <a href="https://dl.sh1mmer.me">dl.sh1mmer.me</a><br />
      Then build an injected shim using your bin at the
      <a href="/builder" target="_self">SH1MMER Web Builder</a><br />
      Once you've obtained a INJECTED SHIM (NOT A RAW SHIM), you can continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Download the
      <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm">
        Chromebook Recovery Utility extension</a> on your personal computer as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the downloads are complete,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.launch)">launch the recovery utility</u>
      and plug your USB drive into your personal computer.
    </p>
    <i>IMPORTANT: Your USB drive will be completely erased and partitioned.</i>
    <p>
      In the recovery utility window, click the settings icon and press "Use
      local image".
    </p>
    <img src="assets/recovery_utility.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="Chromebook Recovery Utility" />
    <p>
      Select your shim file, identify your USB drive, and start the writing process.
      This can take anywhere between 30 seconds and 20 minutes, depending on the
      speed of your USB drive.
    </p>
    <i>
      You can also use tools such as Rufus, BalenaEtcher, etc, to flash
      on Windows. If you're on Linux, <kbd>dd</kbd> is recommended.
    </i>
    <hr />
    <h3>Executing on Chromebook</h3>
    <p>
      Once writing is complete, enter recovery mode on your Chromebook. This
      is done by pressing the power button (‚èª), reload key (‚Üª), and ESC key at the
      same time. Your screen should look one of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/recover_black.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="Recovery mode (groot UI)" />
    <img src="assets/recover_white.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="Recovery mode (old UI)" />
    <p>Press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> on this screen, then press enter.</p>
    <p>
      It will now say something about "returning to secure mode" or that "OS
      verification is off". You will not actually be in developer mode,
      but the exploit will work regardless. Your screen should look like one
      of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/confirm_black.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="TONORM (groot UI)" />
    <img src="assets/confirm_white.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="TONORM+FWMP (old UI)" />
    <p>
      On this screen, press the power button (‚èª), reload key (‚Üª), and ESC key at
      the same time again! This is very important and cannot be skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it re-shows the original recovery screen, plug your shimmed USB drive
      into your Chromebook. After a brief black-and-white loading screen, you should
      be in the SH1MMER menu.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/utils-select01.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="SH1MMER Beautiful World UI" />
    <p>Play around with the UI, exit, and reboot.</p>
    <hr />
      <h3>What now?</h3>
      <p>
        You will now be able to, among other things, unenroll your Chromebook.
        It will now behave entirely as if it is a personal computer and no
        longer contain spyware or blocker extensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that while unenrolled, it is recommended to add your personal
        account first, then add your school account, then switch between the two
        as needed. Mercury Workshop does not condone the use of SH1MMER or
        unenrolling to cheat in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenges with unenrolling are connecting to the school
        network and taking state or national exams (since there are no kiosk
        apps anymore).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many methods to get a school Wi-Fi password while enrolled,
        including
        <a href="https://luphoria.com/netlog-policy-password-tool">the policy netlog trick</a>. While on a school
        account
        and unenrolled, you can bypass some network-level blocks
        by using a secure DNS such as Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 from
        <kbd>chrome://os-settings/osPrivacy</kbd>. It is also recommended to
        enable "MAC Address Randomization" in <kbd>chrome://flags</kbd> to stay
        hidden.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/secure_dns.png" alt="Secure DNS" />
      <img src="assets/mac_randomization.png" alt="MAC Address Randomization" />
      <p>
        To take a kiosk exam, the safest option is to re-enroll temporarily.
        Instructions for doing that are hosted
        <a href="assets/kiosks.txt">at this TXT file</a>. Saving a copy of this file
        for future reference is probably a smart move.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use <a href="https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/fakemurk">fakemurk</a>
        as a way to enroll your device but stay in developer mode and have control
        over policies and extensions. You may need to use this to get WiFi passwords
        if <kbd>chrome://net-export</kbd> is blocked.
      </p>

    <h3>The Fog...</h3>
    <h4>(Google's response, and why this might not be working for you)</h4>
    <p>
      Downgrading and unenrollment has been patched* by google. If your chromebook has never updated to version 112
      before (check in <kbd>chrome://version</kbd>), then you can ignore this and follow the normal instructions. If not,
      unenrollment will not work as normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you aren't willing to take apart your chromebook to unenroll, you can use an affiliated project,
      <a href="https://fog.gay">E-HALCYON</a> to boot into a deprovisioned environment temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also <a href="/cryptosmite">cryptosmite</a>, which allows you to unenroll if you are on version v119 or earlier. 
      It is possible to downgrade to v112 to unenroll if your Chromebook meets the requirements. 
      This is currently the recommended method over E-HALYCON.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are willing to take apart your Chromebook to unenroll, then go to the guides 
      here: <a href="/unpatch" target="_self" >Unpatch</a> & <a href="/unfog" target="_self" >Unfog</a>
