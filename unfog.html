      <h3>What is Unfog?</h3>
      <p>
        Unfog is a guide that explains how to downgrade Chromebooks even after if
        it was affected by <i>The Fog</i>. It was found by a user on Discord named
        <a href="https://discord.com/users/476169716998733834">@olyb</a>
        and was released on October 1st, 2023.

      <h4>
        If this isn't working for you, use:
        <a href="https://fog.gay">E-Halcyon</a>
        instead.

      <h3>What you'll need</h3>
      <li>
        <u onclick="alert(messages.chromebook); ">A Chromebook</u>; it has to be
        un-enrolled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u onclick="alert(messages.screw); ">A screwdriver</u>; this is needed
        to open up the Chromebook.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u onclick="alert(messages.usb); ">A USB</u>; you need this to boot into
        a bash shell.
      </li>
      <hr />
      <h3>Disabling WP</h3>
      <p>
        First, you'll need to unplug everything in the Chromebook, such as the
        charger, any USB devices, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take your <u onclick="alert(messages.screw);">screwdriver</u> and open
        the back panel of your Chromebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find the battery cable and unplug it from the Chromebook, this should
        disable the Write Protection on the majority of Chromebooks. If not,
        search up what your WP method for your Chromebook is online.
      </p>
      <p>An <b>example</b> of the battery connector location is shown below:</p>
      <img src="assets/unpatch_battery.webp" alt="Unpatch Battery" />
      <img src="assets/unpatch_battery_connector.webp" alt="Unpatch Battery Connector" />
      <br />
        <i>The Chromebook shown here is the Acer Chromebook 311 (C733).</i>
      <p>
        Plug in the charger, and turn on the Chromebook. Yes, this will work as
        the Chromebook will run from the power of the charger.
      </p>
      <p>
        On some Chromebooks such as <kbd>DEDEDE</kbd>, you will need to jump
        two pins to disable WP. You can easily do this by taking out the 
        motherboard and using a paperclip to jump the two.
      </p>
        <i>
          This is the case for you if WP doesn't disable after unplugging the battery.
        </i>

      <img src="assets/unpatch_jumper_pins.webp" alt="Unpatch Jumper Pins" />
      <br />
        <i>
          The Chromebook shown here is the Acer Chromebook Spin 511 (R753T).
        </i>
      <p>
        If the Chromebook fails to boot from the charger because it bootloops at
        the developer mode screen, hold <kbd>Power (⏻) + Reload (↻) + ESC</kbd>
        till you're at the recovery screen to continue to the next step.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Executing Commands</h3>
      <p>
        Boot into SH1MMER or RecoMod and then enter the "Bash Shell". 
        You cannot do this in ChromeOS due to the last command.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Bash Shell, execute the following commands below: <br />
        <kbd>/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090</kbd><br />
        <kbd>tpm_manager_client take_ownership</kbd><br />
        <kbd>chromeos-tpm-recovery</kbd>
      </p>
      <i>The first command isn't necessary, but is highly recommended.</i>
      <p>The commands should report "success" at the end like this image:</p>
      <img src="assets/unfog_bash_shell.webp" alt="Unfog Bash Shell" />
      <br />
      <i>If this doesn't work, run <kbd>flashrom --wp-disable</kbd> then try again.</i>
      <p>
        Exit SH1MMER (or RecoMod) and turn off your Chromebook. Unplug everything 
        including the charger, reconnect the battery, and then reconnect the charger.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Aftermath</h3>
      <p>
        After the Chromebook is powerwashed (as it disables devmode when doing this), 
        the Chromebook <i>should</i> now be able to install any ChromeOS version without
        showing the "out-of-date" error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically you will only need to do this once and then be able to downgrade to
        out-of-date ChromeOS versions at any time, however:
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a slight chance that when you update to a version past 111 (such as 112
        and later), you may receive the out-of-date error again. To fix this, simply repeat
        the steps you did again in this guide.
