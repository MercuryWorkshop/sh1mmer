    <p>Certain sites may be selling sh1mmer or bundling it with purchases.
      These sites typically claim to offer many features for your chromebook,
      while in reality they just provide a collection of freely available
      software, illegally.</p>
    <p>The sh1mmer recovery tool is strictly distributed as a free download
      from this website. Any kind of sale, bundling, or redistribution in
      association with commercial activity is strictly forbidden and a
      violation of copyright. Don’t let them scam you into paying money for
      free stuff!</p>
    <p>If you have clearly been sold this software, you should report them
      to their payment processor (often ClickBank, Plimus, or PayPal) and
      demand your money back. Keep in mind that this kind of sale is illegal
      (selling our free software is a violation of copyright) and also
      fraudulent. If the payment processor refuses to issue a refund, contact
      your credit card company and request a chargeback.</p>
